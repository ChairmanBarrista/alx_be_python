#This task is to complete a Python script that calculates the simple interest earned on an investment over a period of time.
#The formula for simple interest is (I = P * R * T), where:

#( I ) is the interest earned,
#( P ) is the principal amount (initial investment),
#( R ) is the annual interest rate (as a decimal),
#( T ) is the time the money is invested for in years.

principal = 1000 #amount invested
rate = 0.05 #0.05 represents 5% interest per annum
time = 3 #3 represents 3 years

#formular to get the interest is(I = P * R * T)
interest = principal * rate * time

print("The simple interest is:", interest)
